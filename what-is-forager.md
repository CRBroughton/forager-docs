# What is Forager?

Forager is a web based application for mapping publicly accessible foods. In practice, Forager aims to give you the tools required to enable successful foraging, as well as track those foods you find.

Forager is still in active developement, and is a passion project.
Whilst not all my time is devoted to Forager, I do aim to incrementally improve Forager whenever I have the time.

## Forager's philosophy

When building Forager, I have maintained the following principles for my users:

- Your data belongs to you
- The responsibility of hosting Forager belongs to you
- Forager will forever be open-source, under the GPLV2 license

Naturally the above ideals mean that Forager has no public instance; You
cannot sign up to Forager like traditional web applications
you might be used to. The application's hosting, data governance
and protection are your sole responsibilty.

Any users you might wish to give access to your instance of Forager,
are also your responsibilty.

All required API keys to enable the use of Forager are also your responsibilty.
